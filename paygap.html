			<h1>Gender paygap and numbers</h1>
			<h2>What is the gender paygap?</h2>
			The (unadjusted) gender pay gap (GPG) is the relative difference between the average gross hourly earnings of women and men in the private sector<sup>1</sup>. As an unadjusted indicator, the GPG gives an overall picture of the differences in pay between men and women.
			
			<h2>Tell me numbers!</h2>
			The average income for a person in European Union (EU) is 24 124 Euro (2020)<sup>2</sup>. For the economy as a whole, in 2020, women's gross hourly earnings were on average 13.0 % below those of men in the European Union<sup>3</sup>. Which means if one person earns 25.000 EUR, another person would earn 3250 EUR less.

			This is a cynical game about the Gender Paygap. If you are into numbers, please <a href="paygap.html">read more about this this topic</a>.
			<h2>But why?</h2>
			A statistical analysis explains some of the reasons for the gender pay gap in the EU<sup>3</sup>. Women work part-time and in lower paying economic activities more often than men do. But on the other hand, women are expected to earn more than men would, due to their higher average education level and due to their higher average occupations. Other variables as working time (full- or part-time), age, private and public sector also play a role for different incomes between women and men. After analyzing those factors, an average unexplained gender pay gap of 11.2 % remains in the EU. Some of this gap might be because of possible differences in pay between men and women for equal work.

			<h2>What to do?</h2>
			The right of women and men to equal pay for work of equal value belongs to the European Pillar of Social Rights, which was endorsed at the Social Summit for Fair Jobs and Growth, Gothenburg, Sweden, November 2017<sup>4</sup>.
			<strong>If you are in the position to decide about wage or employment, please think of this and don't make any difference between genders.</strong>
